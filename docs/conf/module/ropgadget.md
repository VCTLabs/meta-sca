# Available configuration for ropgadget

This module is somehow different - it tries to get all code which is somehow exploitable by ROP (return oriented programming).
If the number of findings exceeds the configured threshold value a warning is issued.
The findings themselves are only created as "info" level findings.
So if you actually want to see the details you can have a look into the raw-file or you have to configure SCA_WARNING_LEVEL to "info".
